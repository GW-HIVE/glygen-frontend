                        GlyGen is a data integration and dissemination
                        project for carbohydrate and glycoconjugate
                        related data. GlyGen retrieves information from
                        multiple international data sources and integrates
                        and harmonizes this data. This web portal allows
                        exploring this data and performing unique
                        searches that cannot be executed in any of the
                        integrated databases alone.
